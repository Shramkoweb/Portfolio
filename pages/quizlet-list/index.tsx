          Quizlet QuickList: The Easiest Way to Collect and Study New Words
        </h1>

        <p>
          Hey there! If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably come across tons of new
          words while reading online in a foreign language. You know how
          frustrating it can be to stop, copy each word, and paste it somewhere
          to study later.
        </p>

        <p>
          That‚Äôs why I created
          {' '}

          and have everything neatly organized for Quizlet or any study app you
          love.
