Small tasks that we put off can accumulate and ultimately consume much more of our time and energy. One such small yet important task is unsubscribing from annoying email newsletters and notifications.

When you receive a new email with an unnecessary newsletter, it's better to decide to unsubscribe from it right away. Yes, it may take a couple of minutes, but in the future, you'll save yourself a lot of time and nerves by getting rid of constant distractions.

Just like with task automation: when you set up a project once, the time invested in that process will pay off in the future by reducing routine tasks and increasing productivity.

Don't forget that small tasks, if postponed, can turn into a big to-do list. And then you'll have to spend much more time and effort to deal with them. This can become a cause of procrastination and worsen your efficiency.

So, don't procrastinate unsubscribing from newsletters. Take a couple of minutes [[atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)] now and get rid of unnecessary distractions in the future.
